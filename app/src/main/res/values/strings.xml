        "Discussions: Cancer specific

Please remember that these discussion boards are a public forum, which means open to the public (i.e. nonmembers).

Other areas are restricted to members only and cannot be found by nonmembers.

Chat Etiquette

Internet chat can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience when participants follow simple etiquette. The basic dos and don’ts are:

Do:
    Be polite. Say hello when you enter the chat lobby or any chat room. If you are already in chat and someone enters, say hello and welcome them.
    Be mindful of how you express yourself. What you type on the screen is how others get to know you. Social cues used in face to face interactions such as body language, facial expressions, voice tone and volume, etc. are eliminated when communicating in writing.
    Be respectful. You will not agree with everyone’s opinions, beliefs, and choices. And not everyone will agree with yours. This is normal and it's okay for people to disagree. However, it is essential that members respect each other's right to have their own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs.
    Remember that you are you are talking to real, live people with feelings, cancer concerns and issue just like you.
    Leave the chat room if anyone makes you feel uncomfortable or causes you distress.
    Ensure confidentiality and privacy. Use a member’s username (screen name) rather than real name to respect their privacy.
    Members may share personal information but it is strongly recommended that personal identifiers not be shared.
    Report suspicious behavior or site violations to letscopesupport@gmail.com
Don’t

    Don’t share your name, email or street address, phone number or other personal identifiers.
    Don’t tell others what they should or shouldn’t think, feel, believe, or do.
    Don’t worry about spelling. Typos and spelling mistakes are to be expected when chatting online. Sometimes they are funny and give us something to laugh about together.
    Don’t be rude, offensive or engage in personal attacks (flames) or threats.
    Don’t investigate other members. If you have a concern about someone, report it to letscopesupport@gmail.com
    Do not sell; advertise/promote cures, treatments, research studies, products, or services.
    Do not use the chat rooms to interview or recruit members for ANY reason, including research studies, papers, articles, testimonials, media, student projects, events, memberships, or volunteer roles.
    You may report inappropriate uses of private chat to letscopesupport@gmail.com"
